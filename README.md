# App integration tools class

- Omar Trejo
- May, 2016

This is the code for the final project for a class that I took at ITAM for
concurrent systems. The code is for a basic online shop. It was created using
Java and OpenESB, a Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) engine for the
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) architecture. This repository is for pedagogic
purposes about ESB and BPEL. Other than that it's not very useful.
